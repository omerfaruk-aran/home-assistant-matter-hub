## 📝 About

This project simulates bridges to publish your entities from Home Assistant to any Matter-compatible controller like
Alexa, Apple Home or Google Home. Using Matter, those can be connected easily using local communication without the need
of port forwarding etc.

## 🤖 Robot Vacuum Server Mode

<details>
<summary><strong>⚠️ Important: Apple Home & Alexa require Server Mode for Robot Vacuums</strong> (click to expand)</summary>

### The Problem

Apple Home and Alexa **do not properly support bridged robot vacuums**. When your vacuum is exposed through a standard Matter bridge, you may experience:

- **Apple Home**: "Updating" status, Siri commands don't work, room selection fails
- **Alexa**: Vacuum is not discovered at all

This is because these platforms expect robot vacuums to be **standalone Matter devices**, not bridged devices.

### The Solution: Server Mode

**Server Mode** exposes your vacuum as a standalone Matter device without the bridge wrapper. This makes it fully compatible with Apple Home and Alexa.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Create a new bridge** in the Matter Hub web interface
2. **Enable "Server Mode"** checkbox in the bridge creation wizard
3. Add **only your vacuum** to this bridge
4. **Pair the new Server Mode bridge** with Apple Home or Alexa
5. Your other devices stay on your regular bridge(s)

### Important Notes

- Server Mode bridges support **exactly one device**
- Your vacuum needs its own dedicated Server Mode bridge
- Other device types (lights, switches, sensors) work fine on regular bridges
- After switching to Server Mode, Siri commands like "Hey Siri, start the vacuum" will work

### Documentation

## Installation

### Home Assistant Add-on (Recommended)

Add this repository to your Add-on Store:

```
https://github.com/RiDDiX/home-assistant-addons
```

Two add-ons are available:
- **Home-Assistant-Matter-Hub** - Stable release
- **Home-Assistant-Matter-Hub (Alpha)** - Pre-release for testing

### Docker

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name home-assistant-matter-hub \
  --network host \
  -v /path/to/data:/data \
  -e HAMH_HOME_ASSISTANT_URL=http://192.168.178.123:8123 \
  -e HAMH_HOME_ASSISTANT_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_long_lived_access_token \
  ghcr.io/riddix/home-assistant-matter-hub:latest
```

> **Note:** All environment variables require the `HAMH_` prefix.
> See the [Installation Guide](docs/Getting%20Started/Installation.md) for all available options.

For alpha versions, use tag `alpha` instead of `latest`.

## 🔧 Network Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>⚠️ "No Response" / Connection Drops — Common Network Causes</strong> (click to expand)</summary>

### The Problem

Your Matter devices suddenly show **"No Response"** (Apple Home), **"Unavailable"** (Google Home), or become **unresponsive** after some time — even though the bridge is still running and other controllers (e.g., Alexa) continue to work fine.

### Root Cause: Network Equipment Blocking mDNS/Multicast

Matter relies heavily on **mDNS (multicast DNS)** for device discovery and reachability. Many routers, access points, and managed switches have features that **filter, throttle, or block multicast traffic** — which breaks Matter communication silently.

> **💡 This was confirmed and documented thanks to the excellent systematic testing by [@omerfaruk-aran](https://github.com/omerfaruk-aran) in [#129](https://github.com/RiDDiX/home-assistant-matter-hub/issues/129).** The issue was traced to a TP-Link Archer AX50 (in AP mode) sitting between the Apple TV and the network — its default settings were blocking/limiting mDNS/Bonjour traffic over time.

### What to Check on Your Network Equipment

1. **IGMP Snooping** — Disable or configure it to allow mDNS (`224.0.0.251` / `ff02::fb`)
2. **Multicast Optimization / Multicast Enhancement** — Disable (often called "Airtime Fairness" or "Multicast to Unicast")
3. **AP Isolation / Client Isolation** — Must be **disabled** so devices on the same network can communicate
4. **mDNS / Bonjour Forwarding** — Enable if available (some enterprise APs have this)
5. **DHCP Server on secondary devices** — Disable DHCP on access points / switches that are NOT your main router (multiple DHCP servers cause IP conflicts)
6. **Firmware Updates** — Update your router/AP firmware, as multicast handling is frequently improved

### Affected Equipment (Known Cases)

| Device | Issue | Fix |
|--------|-------|-----|
| **TP-Link Archer AX50** (AP mode) | mDNS traffic blocked/limited over time | Firmware update + disable DHCP on the AP |
| **Ubiquiti UniFi APs** | IGMP Snooping can filter mDNS | Disable IGMP Snooping or enable mDNS Reflector |
| **Managed Switches** (various) | Multicast filtering enabled by default | Allow mDNS multicast groups |

### Quick Diagnostic Steps

1. **Does Alexa still work when Apple Home shows "No Response"?**
   - **Yes** → Bridge is online, the issue is network path / mDNS related
   - **No** → Bridge may actually be down, check HAMH logs

2. **Does removing a Home Hub (HomePod/Apple TV) fix it?**
   - **Yes** → The hub's network path is affected (AP/switch between hub and bridge)
   - **No** → May be a different issue

3. **Try binding mDNS to a specific interface:**
   ```
   --mdns-network-interface eth0
   ```
   (or `end0`, `enp0s18`, etc. — check your system)

### Network Topology Tips

- **Keep the path simple**: Avoid placing access points or managed switches between your Matter bridge (Home Assistant) and your Home Hub (HomePod/Apple TV)
- **Use wired connections** where possible for Home Hubs and the Home Assistant host
- **Same subnet**: All Matter devices, controllers, and the bridge must be on the same Layer 2 network / subnet
- **IPv6**: Matter uses IPv6 link-local addresses — make sure IPv6 is not disabled on your network

## Migration from t0bst4r

Migrating from the original `t0bst4r/home-assistant-matter-hub` is straightforward. **Your Matter fabric connections and paired devices will be preserved!**

### Home Assistant Add-on

1. **Backup your data:**
   ```bash
   cp -r /addon_configs/*_hamh /config/hamh-backup
   # Verify the backup was copied correctly
   ls /config/hamh-backup
   ```

2. **Uninstall the old add-on** (Settings → Add-ons → Uninstall) and make sure the old folder is removed:
   ```bash
   rm -rf /addon_configs/*_hamh
   ```

3. **Add the new repository:**
   ```
   https://github.com/RiDDiX/home-assistant-addons
   ```

4. **Install and start the new add-on once** (creates the data folder), then **stop it**

5. **Clear the new folder and restore your backup:**
   ```bash
   rm -rf /addon_configs/*_hamh/*
   cp -r /config/hamh-backup/* /addon_configs/*_hamh/
   ```

6. **Start the add-on again** - your devices should reconnect automatically

### Docker / Docker Compose

Simply change the image from:
```
ghcr.io/t0bst4r/home-assistant-matter-hub:latest
```
to:
```
ghcr.io/riddix/home-assistant-matter-hub:latest
```

Your volume mounts stay the same - no data migration needed.
